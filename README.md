# Classic Arcade Game Clone
___

This is a Udacity Front-end Nanodegree Third Project, A Part of my Google India Scholarship-2018. The idea is to recreate a simple clone of the classic Frogger arcade game.

## How to play

Click on this link to play the game:

__*************__ [Cross the Road to reach the River](https://) __*************__

Use the arrow keys to move your player across the bug infested road and reach the safety of the Great Blue Bug Free sector. Score 1 point for each successful crossing. Watch-out!! The bugs fight back and score points against you every time they run you over. They also get angrier and meaner the more wins you score.
